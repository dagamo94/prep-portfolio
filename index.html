                    <div id="about-text">
                        <p>With an innate curiosity, I am always looking to learn new skills. This is how I learned how to do IT, freelance as a photographer, started my programming journey, and will learn any new skills required to thrive in any environment.</p>
                        <p>
                        Here at Thinkful, I am really excited to keep sharpening my programming skills to eventually land a job as a Front End Developer; potentially with you!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        If you are looking for a developer to get your website looking sharp and intuitive to your users, look no further, you have come to the right place! If you are a developer looking to collab and get some help with the front facing aspect of you website or app, hit me up and let's work together!
                        </p>
                        <p>A few more things I enjoy outside of programming:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Going to the mountains and loosing track of time hiking.</li>
                            <li>Long Road Trips.</li>
                            <li>Looking for the best spots to grab a bite in town or anywhere I am visiting.</li>
